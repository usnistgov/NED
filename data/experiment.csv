6. The panel connections were designed according to the requirements for parts and
components of NZS 1170.5 (2004).
7. Slotted connections tested consisted of two mild steel rods of 20 mm diameter connecting the panels to the underside of the beam through a horizontally slotted steel angle.slotted connections were formed from 150x150x10 equal angle steel sections with a horizontal slot cut out of one side.
8. The length of the rods was 120 mm and was able to slide horizontally through the slot in the angle. A large washer was used on either side to ensure the rod could not pull through the slot.
9.Slot length=300mm, Number of connections = 4, tube spacer used.
10. A variation of the connection was proposed by placing a tubular spacer between the washers and tightening the two washers against the tube.",No Damage,'',,Story Drift Ratio,Ratio,0.035,'','',,,No Damage,''
