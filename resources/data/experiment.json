Full-bay, singlestorey panel (L=3775mm, H=2975mm, 120mm thick; window size: L=2005mm, H=1615mm)\n2. Had a central, single opening where a window would normally be located. \n3. contained a single layer of reinforcement in each direction.The panels are reinforced with D12\u2019s at 200 mm centres and D16 bars around the opening and external perimeter. 1.0 m length D16s also run diagonally at each corner opening\n4. A 28 day concrete compressive strength of 40 MPa was specified for the panels. Grade\n300 steel was used for reinforcement.\n5. The precast concrete panels were attached to the frame using two different connection\ntypes: bearing connections and UFP connections. The bearing connections located at the\nbase of the panels, and the UFP connections were located at the top of the panel.\n6. The UFP connections were bolted to the underside of the top beams using 300 mm long\nt-channels that were cast into the concrete.\n7. The connection to the panels made use of the 10 mm thick steel plates secured to the panel with four cast-in ferrule anchors. \n8. Including housed and unhoused UFPs as well as the UFPs in different orientations.\n9. No of connections = 4 (4UFPs), Housed\n10. slotted connections were attached to the top of the panel to provide out-of-plane restraint\n11. UFP is 8 mm thick, 120 mm wide Grade 300 steel plate. The fabricator of the UFPs was a local spring maker who heated the plates prior to bending. Each UFP was bent around a fixed diameter of 120 mm.",

Upper tieback connections are designed to accomodate seismic drifts through a flexing of the tieback rod with a ductile plate attachement to asbsorb plastic out of plane deformations. The joint size was 1\u2019\u2019 for the butt-return joint and \u00be\u2019\u2019 for the miter joint, which allowed a movement of 1.06\u2019\u2019 due to the inclination.

Nonlinear time history analyses of the building were conducted and used to predict interstory drift ratios (IDRs) anticipated during design and maximum credible earthquake events and were used to size the joints and design the slotted and flexing rod connections. The expected peak drifts were 2% and 1.1% at the fourth and fifth level, respectively. In terms of forces, the preliminary analysis predicted a short period spectral acceleration SDS of 2.33 g, 1.60 g and 2.84 at the fourth floor, fifth floor, and roof respectively.\"",
